1. How many searches?
    - searching for 8
        - 12, 6, 8
    - searching for 16
        - 12, 17, 14, 15, 'start > end' - return -1

2. Testing Search Efficiency - Linear vs Binary
    - In general, linear search took about 50 tries on average, varying quite wildly on any given input. If the input did not exist, this took 100 tries.
    - In general, Binary search took about 4 or 5 tries on average, varying between 3 and 6 for the most part. If the input did not exist, this took 8 searches to discover.

3. Find a book
    - This is how I would go about finding a specific book in the library with a Dewey Decimal index.

    1) I would first determine where the first books, the books with the lowest dewey decimal numbers are located.
    2) I would then determine the location of where the dewey decimal indexed books end and get the number there.
    3) Based on the dewey decimal range, I would then take the dewey decimal value for the book I am looking for and do a rough calculation of where in the range this book might fall. Lets say I think it is around 25% of the range.
    4) I would then approximate what book shelf would match 25% based on the beginning and ending of the dewey decimal section.
    5) Next, I'd peek at a book at the beginning of this shelf and determine if it is above or below my target value.
      5a) if below, I'd move towards the end of the books (and judge the size of my jump based on how big of a gap between the target and actual). 
      5b) if above, I'd move towards the beginning of the books. (and judge the size of my jump based on how big of a gap between the target and actual)
      5c) if I am close and spot my book, I'll grab it and be on my way.
    6) I would repeat step 5 until I found my book.

4. Searching in a BST
    1) post-order: 14, 19, 15, 27, 25, 79, 90, 91, 89, 35
    2) pre-order: 8, 6, 5, 7, 10, 9, 11

6. Find the next commanding officer
    - Rank: Captain Picard, Commander Riker, Commander Data, Lieutenant Commander Worf, Lieutenant Commander LaForge, Lieutenant Commander Crusher, Lieutenant Security Officer, Lieutenant Selar

7. Max profit
    -  Max profit would be if you bought at $97 per share and sold at $123 per share, profiting $26 per share.
